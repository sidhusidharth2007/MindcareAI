MindcareAI is a compassionate mental health support assistant powered by Google Gemini.

## 🔐 Setup: Adding your API Key to GitHub

The application needs an API key to talk to the AI. Follow these steps to set it up:

1.  Go to your repository **Settings** tab.
2.  On the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3.  Click the green **New repository secret** button.
4.  Name: `API_KEY`
5.  Value: (Paste your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio)
6.  Click **Add secret**.
7.  Go to the **Actions** tab and **Re-run** the latest deployment job.

## 🚀 How to upload code without "Sync Error"

Avoid using the "Drag and Drop" feature in the browser for large folders.

1.  **Delete `node_modules`** from your computer folder first.
2.  Use **GitHub Desktop** (recommended) to "Publish" your code.
3.  The `.gitignore` file included here will automatically prevent large unnecessary files from being uploaded.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
*   **White Screen**: This happens if the build failed. Check the **Actions** tab for errors.
*   **"Key Missing" Screen**: This means you haven't added the secret mentioned above yet.
*   **Sync Error**: GitHub web uploader is limited. Use the GitHub Desktop app.
